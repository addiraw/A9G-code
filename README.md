## 3.0 Technical Details

### a. Product Brief

The proposed design aims at increasing awareness of the people towards air pollution by 
providing them with the useful information such as AQI (Air Quality Index), deviation of AQI 
with respect to time of the day and traffic at different regions and pollution hotspots in a 
precise, comprehensive and graphical manner through an application with a user friendly 
interface. The information will also be represented on map through which people will be 
made aware about the most and least polluted regions and suggest users best possible 
routes.Through our data analysis system we will also be able to predict and alert public for an 
approaching critical situation via push notifications to prepare the citizens for necessary steps 
to be taken. The device comprises of gas sensor, dust sensor, thermal and humidity sensor, 
GPS and GSM module and MSP launch-pad (microcontroller). The device is transportable 
and easy to install in public transits due to its compact design and power efficiency. The 
devices will work in a synchronized network increasing the accuracy of the system. 

##  2.0 Business Details

###  a. Project Abstract

The main aim of the device is to increase public awareness towards air pollution and provide 
the necessary information in public domain. The proposed design consists of a highly 
transportable device which can be installed in public transit. The device will employ the 
means of multiple sensors to sample the air; the collected information will be analyzed and 
will be made available in public domain through a mobile application and map. The data will 
be represented in a comprehensive, graphical manner and map representation of the 
information will help traffic authorities to manage traffic for the public to take better routes 
or use public transport with respect to severity of the pollution. The product potentially 
targets the market of Public transit and private users with other modes like in-app 
advertisement and marketing of collected data to Data Analysis, Big data Clients and research 
organizations. 

### b. Proposed Design

### c. Innovativeness of the Proposed Solution

###  d. Impact of the proposed solution

If our product is launched in the market it will definitely increase the awareness 
towards air pollution by providing comprehensive information and moderating 
the traffic by diverting heavy traffic through our Mobile's application which 
would suggest better routes and less polluted routes. It will make people take 
precautionary measures such as wearing pollution mask using public transport 
and also help responsible authorities to take necessary action for reducing air 
pollution by alerting for critical air condition in a region by moderating the 
traffic or restricting construction work which will ultimately reduce the health 
related problems caused by air pollution.

### A9G all code for different Task
